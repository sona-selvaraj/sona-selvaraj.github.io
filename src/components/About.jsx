            My tech journey began with a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science in India, where I laid the groundwork for my passion in building things that work â€” and work smart. I kicked off my career as a Data Engineer at Kaar Technologies, where I got a front-row seat to the fast-paced world of enterprise tech. There, I learned more than just tools and pipelines â€” I honed essential skills like cross-functional teamwork, real-world problem solving, and managing tight deadlines with a cool head.

            Driven by a desire to deepen my technical expertise, I decided to pursue a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at Clark University. This experience opened me up to diverse perspectives, cutting-edge concepts, and an exciting world of possibility in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Somewhere between research papers and late-night debugging sessions, I discovered my love for blending software development with smart, adaptive systems.

            Since then, Iâ€™ve been building projects that bridge both worlds â€” from intelligent web apps to ML-powered tools â€” always with an eye for clean design, scalable architecture, and a touch of curiosity. I'm passionate about creating tech that doesn't just execute tasks but understands context, adapts, and evolves â€” kind of like my career path.
